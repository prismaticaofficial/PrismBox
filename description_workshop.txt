>prismBox, a mod built by Prismatica.
=====================================

When I started modding, I found myself consistently restarting from the ground up with new functions and ideas.
Instead of re-inventing the wheel like I have been, I instead created a "pseudo-library" to help expedite the process.
That is what >prismBox is, a collection of helpers and framework changes to make modding for me easier.
