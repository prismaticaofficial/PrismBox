>prismBox, a mod built by Prismatica.
=====================================

When I started modding, I found myself consistently restarting from the ground up with new functions and ideas.
Instead of re-inventing the wheel like I have been, I instead created a "pseudo-library" to help expedite the process.
That is what >prismBox is, a collection of helpers and framework changes to make modding for me easier.

FEATURES OF NOTE

EC Based Architecture
- Extends to Items, Players and NPCs.
- Soon to introduce: Projectiles, Tiles.

- A variety of different extensions for NPCs, Players and Items to shorthand code.
- Notables include basic NPC movement, Player States and Entities surrounding other Entities (i.e. closest player, players in range, etc.)
- UI Extension as well for shortening the default settings in initialization.

Helpers
- World File Loading in-mod via file path.
- Crossmod Helper for basic item modification / compat control
- Localization for getting a random localtext from a list (useful for dialogue / random responses)
