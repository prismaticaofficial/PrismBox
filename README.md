# PRISMBOX

PrismBox is a mod designed to make modding easier for me. Perhaps it can help you, too.
<br><br>

## WHAT IS THIS?

As defined above, PrismBox is a personal-use library I am working on that I've decided to make public. <br>
A lot of this is experimental / helper functions to make modding for me easier. However, I figured letting anyone else use it is fine. <br> <br>

Do note we use the GPL3.0 License, meaning any project you create with PrismBox must be open source! <br> <br>

For a detailed documentation and feature showcase, please visit the provided wiki in this repository (as of 3/10/2024, still working on it!) <br>
